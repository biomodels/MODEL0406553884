**Abstract:**   
The morphology of the cardiac transverse-axial tubular system (TATS) has been
known for decades, but its function has received little attention. To explore
the possible role of this system in the physiological modulation of electrical
and contractile activity, we have developed a mathematical model of rat
ventricular cardiomyocytes in which the TATS is described as a single
compartment. The geometrical characteristics of the TATS, the biophysical
characteristics of ion transporters and their distribution between surface and
tubular membranes were based on available experimental data. Biophysically
realistic values of mean access resistance to the tubular lumen and time
constants for ion exchange with the bulk extracellular solution were included.
The fraction of membrane in the TATS was set to 56%. The action potentials
initiated in current-clamp mode are accompanied by transient K+ accumulation
and transient Ca2+ depletion in the TATS lumen. The amplitude of these changes
relative to external ion concentrations was studied at steady-state
stimulation frequencies of 1-5 Hz. Ca2+ depletion increased from 7 to 13.1%
with stimulation frequency, while K+ accumulation decreased from 4.1 to 2.7%.
These ionic changes (particularly Ca2+ depletion) implicated significant
decrease of intracellular Ca2+ load at frequencies natural for rat heart.
